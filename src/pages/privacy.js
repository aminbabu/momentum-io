              We use non-personally identifiable information to analyze site
              usage (aggregated information about which pages were visited by
              our users) in order to improve the design and content of our
              website.

              When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the
              point of collection the purpose for the collection. We use
              personally identifiable information you provide only to respond to
              your inquiries regarding Momentum and our services or to register
              for programs and events that are sponsored by or co-sponsored by
              other organizations. Should you elect to register electronically
              for any such programs or events, we have no control over the third
              party sponsor’s use of your information, as the privacy policy on
              our website will not apply.

              transfer.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is possible that we may be required to disclose your personally
              identifiable information in response to when required by law or
              when we otherwise believe in good faith that such disclosure is
              required by law, such as in response to a court order, a law
              enforcement agency request, in response to a subpoena, or in
